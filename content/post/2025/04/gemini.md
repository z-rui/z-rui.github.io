余从业代码之事久矣。所谓码积如山，会海滔滔者，诚非虚言也。日则伏案疾书，夜则寻瑕索瘢[^1]。星月为伴，灯火为朋。偶有所成，不过千行之码；顷刻对接，动辄百口[^2]之端。殚精竭虑，寒暑不辍，而发顶日稀，镜中之影，已非少年。

然上官者，不明技艺之精微，不明架构之肯綮[^3]，徒好高谈阔论，口若悬河，唯“新潮”是尚。或朝令而夕改，或纸上而谈兵，吾辈下属，唯唯诺诺，言听计从，实则苦不堪言。指鹿为马，尤令人啼笑皆非。

长此以往，身心俱疲，志气渐磨。与其在此耗神，不如归去！人生几何？韶华易逝，岂能久困于此方寸屏幕之间，受此无谓之煎熬乎？

遂决意挂印而去。临行之际，将最终之稿，入库封存。回望此鏖战数载之所，百感交集，既有怅然，亦有释怀。拂袖转身，顿感体轻，前路纵有未知，亦胜于此无望之内耗也。

此中滋味，非亲历者不能知。唯作俚语小诗一首，聊以自嘲，亦以志今日之决绝也。诗曰：

    码积如山会海滔，
    纠错常致发际高。
    千行代码半天搞，
    百个接口随意调。
    不懂技术瞎指导，
    张口闭口新风潮。
    代码入库呈终稿，
    键盘鼠标皆可抛！

[^1]: **寻瑕索瘢 (xún xiá suǒ bān):** 寻找瑕疵和斑点，此处指代调试代码、修复错误。
[^2]: **百口 (bǎi kǒu):** 指上百个端口或接口（API）。
[^3]: **肯綮 (kěn qìng):** 关键、要害之处。

**Signing Off: A Coder's Farewell**

For years now, I've been down in the coding mines. The talk of "mountains of code and seas of meetings" wasn't just talk; it was the daily reality. Days were spent hunched over a keyboard, fingers flying, while nights often blurred into early mornings, illuminated only by the screen's glow as I hunted down elusive bugs. Stars might wheel overhead, unnoticed; the only constant companion was the hum of the machine.

You churn out thousands of lines, you wrangle countless APIs, you pour your focus into the intricate logic – and for what? The toll is real. I'd catch my reflection and see the creeping sparseness where my hairline used to be. The face looking back wasn't young anymore.

Compounding the grind was management. Bless their hearts, they rarely grasped the technical subtleties, the architectural heart of the work. Instead, they were fond of grand pronouncements and utterly obsessed with the latest buzzwords. Directives came down that were often contradictory, sometimes simply nonsensical – the kind of thing that leaves you speechless, unsure whether to laugh or just cry. We developers learned to just nod along, quietly bearing the absurdity.

It wears you down. Body and soul, you feel the erosion, the slow grinding away of whatever passion brought you here in the first place. I reached a point where I had to ask: Why keep doing this? Life felt too short to stay shackled to this screen, burning out on pointless agony.

So, I decided it was time. I checked in my last piece of code, archiving the final remnants of countless hours. Looking back for a moment at the digital battlefield, a mix of feelings washed over me – a tinge of melancholy, perhaps, but drowned out by an overwhelming wave of relief.

Turning away, I felt lighter than I had in years. Whatever comes next, it has to be better than that soul-crushing grind. Words don't quite capture the feeling, but maybe this little verse comes close:

    Code like mountains, meetings in a flood,
    Bug-hunting nights make hairlines fast recede.
    A thousand lines bashed out at frantic speed,
    A hundred APIs, a tangled mess indeed.
    
    The clueless boss directs things all askew,
    Obsessed with buzzwords, always something "new."
    I pushed my final code, the chapter ends,
    My keyboard, mouse – I toss them to the winds!
